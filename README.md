# EMACS-INIT
My mid-tier Emacs config that won't be perfect untill I have a beard.\
It will obviously get thicker with time (the init file, not the beard).

## What's in there?
init.el    : ye olde, run-of-the-mill init file\
custom.el  : where the terrible mass of shit named "custom set variables" was locked away\
myelfun.el : Elisp functions I wrote and, obvi, use at times.

## Where is this going?
In the quest to build my perfect personal config, shortening \
the amount of keystrokes it takes to perform any given task is the way forward.\
I plan on using emacs registers pretty heavily and I'm also hoping to move this \
config to an org file eventually.
